#GIT Documentation

## Introduction 
*  Welcome, I'll explain what **git** is in the beginning before getting into the specifics. You must first be familiar with how **git** functions and the on what does it depend it has. Git operates on a version control system (VCS), which keeps track of changes made to a file or group of files over time so that you can refer to specific versions in the future. You really need this system if you're a **designer** or **developer** because it simply enables you to roll back your files or even projects to their previous iterations, allowing you to compare changes and determine who made them.
